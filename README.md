## Introduction

This repository contains all the resources we have used to create MIDS W209 final project website. The repository structure is as follows

- data : It contains original mobility data & preprocessed mobility data. 
         All three members fulfil EDA. According to the EDA, most of the mobility data comes from USA and included many NaNs. 
         Thus team decided to focus on US mobility data and applied linear interpolation to fill out NaN in time series mobility dataset.

- peter/ernesto/ellie : Each folder includes Tableau workbook used for our visualization
